# HR Performance Dashboard

Hey there I am Puneet Kathpalia This is a simple HR dashboard I built to help managers keep track of their teams performance. 

What's Inside?

- **Dashboard Home**: See all your team members at a glance
- **Quick Search**: Find people by name, email, or department
- **Bookmarks**: Save profiles you check often

- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes when working late!
